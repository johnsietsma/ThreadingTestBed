# ThreadingTestBed

A few tests of C++11's threads.

There are three areas that are demonstrated:

- Locking
- Conditionals
- Futures and promises.

Uncomment function calls in main.cpp to try different tests.

ThreadingLocks has a few different thread safety mechanisms that can be be uncommented. The default, non-thread safe call will assert.
